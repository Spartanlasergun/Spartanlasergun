### 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a psychologist with a strong interest in data-driven insights and human behavior.  
I use Python primarily for data analysis, statistical modeling, and turning raw information into actionable understanding.

Blending psychology with programming allows me to explore patterns, build tools, and solve real-world problems in meaningful ways.  
Outside of data, I enjoy dabbling in GUI development and building simple websites — combining logic and design to bring ideas to life in interactive ways.
